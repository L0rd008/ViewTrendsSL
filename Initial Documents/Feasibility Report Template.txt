Important instructions  

 

You should write the report pretending you are giving it to the client of your system; report as a professional document. Do not write the report as a personal assignment submission. i.e. write in the third person (avoiding 'I', 'we' and 'you') 

 

Elaborate the content in each sub section  

 

 

Introduction  

 

1.1 Overview of the Project 

This section provides a high level description of the products and/or services of the considered system. It is important that this description captures the most important aspects of the products and/or services that the organization is considering as well as how it may benefit customers and the organization.  

 

1.2 Objectives of the Project  

This section lists the objectives of the system. Eg:  

The objectives of this project is to- 

-	Design and implement …  

-	Provide a ….. 

-	Automate … 

 

1.3 The Need for the Project  

This section describes the usefulness of the system. 

Do NOT write that the project is a requirement of CS3501 

 

1.4 Overview of Existing Systems and Technologies 

This section should explain similar existing systems that achieve or partially achieve the goals of the proposed system.  

Also describes any considerations the organization must make with regards to technology.   

(software development tools and libraries, database systems). 

 

1.5 Scope of the Project 

This section describes the main user roles and list their functionalities within the system. 

 

1.6 Deliverables . 

This section describes the main outputs of the system. Eg: 

A web based software system/ mobile application/ standalone application for…. 

A GUI with …… 

 

2. Feasibility Study  

Financial Feasibility  

This section provides a description of the financial projections the new initiative is expected to yield versus additional costs.   

 

2.2 Technical Feasibility  

This section discusses the technical aspects of the system development and indicates whether the project is technically feasible or not. Included about the technologies you are planning to use. 

(You can always do slight changes during the development to come up with a better final product. Also, sometimes it is difficult to decide the exact tools and techniques that you are going to use during the project, at the initial stage; you can only plan about it. In the final report you can state all the exact implementation details, once the actual product is developed.) 

Do NOT write that, you are familiar with Java, C#, PyTorch etc therefore project can be done. 

 

2.3 Resource and Time Feasibility  

 

This section describes specific hardware and software requirements / resources and time feasibility for the successful completion of the system development.  

 

2.4 Risk Feasibility  

This section describes the risks and risk mitigations 

Do NOT write that you are not familiar with the technologies, so there is a risk. 

 

2.5 Social/Legal Feasibility  

 

3. Considerations  

This section describes the primary concerns related to this project indicating the most important aspects/ features of the system. Eg: Performance, Security, Usability, ease of use. 

 

4. References  

Refer any data/ information in a standard format (eg. IEEE referencing style) 

For different algorithms/ techniques/ theories you can refer text books.  

For tools you can refer web pages.  

For similar work you can refer research paper articles that describe the work. 

You may include white paper articles for the description of technologies; web URL for the tool references. When you refer such a web page, you have to indicate the (Accessed on <<date>>)
