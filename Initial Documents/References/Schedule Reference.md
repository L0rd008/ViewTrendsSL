| Phase | Original Duration | Risk Buffer | Adjusted Duration |
|-------|------------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Phase 1 (Weeks 1-2) | 10 days | 1.5 days | 11.5 days |
| Phase 2 (Week 3) | 5 days | 1 day | 6 days |
| Phase 3 (Week 4) | 5 days | 1.5 days | 6.5 days |
| Phase 4 (Weeks 5-6) | 10 days | 2 days | 12 days |
| Phase 5 (Weeks 7-8) | 10 days | 1.5 days | 11.5 days |
