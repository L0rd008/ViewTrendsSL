## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Project Overview

**Project Name**: ViewTrendsSL - YouTube Viewership Forecasting for Sri Lankan Audience  
**Project Type**: Applied research with practical implementation  
**Duration**: 10 weeks (August 24 - November 1, 2025)  
**Team Size**: 3 undergraduate students  
**Primary Objective**: Develop a localized YouTube viewership prediction system for Sri Lankan content creators

### 1.2 Problem Statement

The digital content creation landscape in Sri Lanka faces a critical information gap. Content creators, digital marketers, and media companies lack access to predictive analytics tools that understand local viewing patterns, cultural contexts, and regional engagement behaviors. Existing global platforms like VidIQ, TubeBuddy, and Social Blade provide historical analytics but fail to capture the nuances of Sri Lankan audience behavior or provide accurate predictive insights for this specific market.

**Quantified Problem Impact:**
- **Market Gap**: No existing tools specifically designed for Sri Lankan YouTube analytics
- **Creator Disadvantage**: Local creators rely on intuition rather than data-driven decisions
- **Economic Impact**: Suboptimal content strategies result in reduced monetization potential
- **Research Gap**: Lack of academic research on regional YouTube viewership patterns

### 1.3 Proposed Solution

ViewTrendsSL addresses this gap through a comprehensive machine learning system that:

**Core Value Propositions:**
1. **Hyper-Local Focus**: Models trained specifically on Sri Lankan viewership data

### 2.3 Market Entry Strategy

#### 2.3.1 Go-to-Market Approach

**Phase 1: Academic Launch (Weeks 9-10)**
- University presentation and demonstration
  * Incomplete or biased metadata
* What **technical risks** are expected?

  * Overfitting of forecasting models
  * Bad model performance due to niche data
  * Limited Sri Lanka-specific content on YouTube
* Any **deployment/maintenance risks**?

  * Hosting limitations
  * Downtime
* What **mitigation strategies** will you adopt? (e.g., caching, data cleaning, backup models)
For every risk, you need a plan.

Risk: API limits halting data collection.

Mitigation: Use efficient API endpoints, implement caching for API calls, and rotate the team's 3 API keys to triple the daily quota.

Risk: Overfitting the model due to niche data.

Mitigation: Use cross-validation during training. Employ regularization techniques in the model (XGBoost has built-in parameters for this). Focus on strong feature engineering rather than overly complex models.

Risk: Bad model performance.

Mitigation: Start with a simple baseline model. If your complex model can't beat a simple average, you know you have a problem. Focus heavily on cleaning the data and creating meaningful features, as this often yields better results than complex model tuning.

Risk: Hosting limitations or downtime.

Mitigation: Use a reputable cloud provider with a good free tier (e.g., Heroku). Implement a free monitoring service like UptimeRobot to get email alerts if your site goes down.

### 2.5 Social/Legal Feasibility

* Are there any **legal constraints** on using YouTube data? (e.g., API Terms of Use, Data Privacy)
* Are you ensuring **compliance** with Googleâ€™s API quota, content policies, or user data restrictions?
* Could the system unintentionally be used for **manipulation or spam**?
* Are there **social impacts** of democratizing forecast data (e.g., equalizing advantage between big and small creators)?
Legal Constraints: Your use of public data for analysis and forecasting is generally considered transformative and falls under fair use, but you must adhere to the YouTube API Terms of Service. Add a disclaimer to your site stating you are not affiliated with YouTube and link to their ToS.

Compliance: To ensure compliance, log all your API calls to monitor quota usage. Do not store any PII from video comments or user data without explicit consent and a privacy policy.

Manipulation/Spam: Acknowledge this risk. The tool's purpose is strategic guidance. You can mitigate misuse by requiring user logins (which adds a barrier to bots) and potentially rate-limiting prediction requests per user.

Social Impact: Frame this as a positive. Your tool democratizes data science, giving smaller Sri Lankan creators access to insights that were previously only available to large media companies with dedicated analyst teams, thus leveling the playing field.
