YouTube Video Viewership Forecasting Model for Sri Lankan Viewer Base


 This project aims to develop a data-driven tool that forecasts the viewership of 
YouTube videos, with a specific focus on the Sri Lankan viewer base.
 Students will utilize the YouTube Data API v3 to collect a real-world dataset of 
public YouTube videos, focusing on channels that are popular in Sri Lanka 
across multiple categories such as news, entertainment, education, and 
lifestyle. The collected data will include video metadata such as publish time, 
category, duration, views, likes, comments, and channel statistics.
 Tasks
 •        Data Collection - Use the YouTube API to extract video-level and 
channel-level data relevant to the Sri Lankan audience.
 •        Data Analysis - Perform comprehensive data cleaning, preprocessing, 
and visualization to uncover patterns in video viewership behavior. Analyze 
variables such as publishing time, day of the week, video length, and content 
category about video performance.
 •        Forecasting Model - Build a model to forecast viewership trends for 
videos given specific features like category, target audience, and historical 
engagement and the video.
 •        Tool Development - Build a web-based system that allows users to input 
video metadata and get forecasting for viewership and view the results of data 
analysis (e.g., dashboard).

Outcomes:
•        A clean, labelled dataset of Sri Lanka–focused 
YouTube video analytics.
 •        A forecasting model capable of estimating expected 
views for a video based on its metadata and the video 
content.
 •        A web-based tool demonstrating data analysis and 
predictive model functionality.
 •        A comprehensive project report and presentation 
documenting the methodology, findings, and limitations.
