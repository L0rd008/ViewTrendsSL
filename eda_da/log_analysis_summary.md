# EDA Log Analysis Summary - ViewTrendsSL

## Key Findings from Enhanced EDA Pipeline Execution

### Data Quality Issues Identified

**Duration Parsing Problems:**
- **Issue**: 271 videos (1.79%) have unparseable duration format "P0D" 
- **Impact**: These videos are assigned 0 seconds duration, affecting Shorts classification
- **Recommendation**: Investigate source data quality and implement fallback duration detection

### Dataset Overview
- **Total Videos**: 15,112 videos across 121 features
- **Memory Usage**: 98.80 MB
- **Data Completeness**: Significant missing data pattern in time-series (day 21-30: 70-100% missing)
- **No Duplicates**: 0 duplicate video IDs found

### Content Distribution Analysis
- **Shorts**: 4,563 videos (30.2%)
- **Long-form**: 10,549 videos (69.8%)
- **Statistical Significance**: All performance metrics show highly significant differences (p < 0.001) between Shorts and Long-form content

### Performance Metrics Comparison

| Metric | Shorts (Mean) | Long-form (Mean) | Difference |
|--------|---------------|------------------|------------|
| **View Count** | 10,979 | 19,860 | +81% for Long-form |
| **Like Count** | 212 | 383 | +81% for Long-form |
| **Comment Count** | 6.5 | 43.8 | +573% for Long-form |
| **Like Rate** | 1.97% | 2.45% | +24% for Long-form |
| **Comment Rate** | 0.22% | 0.56% | +155% for Long-form |

### Growth Pattern Classification Results
- **Steady Growth**: 14,703 videos (97.3%) - Most common pattern
- **Flash in Pan**: 270 videos (1.8%) - Quick spike then decline
- **Viral Spike**: 138 videos (0.9%) - Explosive early growth
- **Slow Burn**: 1 video (0.0%) - Gradual acceleration

### Publication Timing Insights

**Peak Performance Hours:**
- **Hour 15 (3 PM)**: Highest average views (87,134)
- **Hour 14 (2 PM)**: Second highest (24,829)
- **Hour 7 (7 AM)**: Third highest (23,590)

**Best Days for Publishing:**
- **Thursday**: Highest average views (20,887)
- **Friday**: Second highest (19,581)
- **Tuesday**: Third highest (18,191)

### Feature Importance for ML Pipeline

**Top Predictive Features (Correlation with View Count):**
1. **Like Count**: 0.95 correlation - Strongest predictor
2. **Week 1 Growth**: 0.93 correlation - Early momentum critical
3. **Initial Velocity**: 0.75 correlation - Day 1 performance key
4. **Comment Count**: 0.38 correlation - Moderate predictor
5. **Publish Hour**: 0.06 correlation - Weak but measurable impact

**Negative Correlations:**
- Comment Rate: -0.026 (higher comment rates don't predict higher views)
- Engagement Rate: -0.017 (overall engagement rate weakly negative)

### Critical Data Quality Recommendations

1. **Duration Data Cleaning**: Fix "P0D" parsing issue affecting 271 videos
2. **Missing Data Strategy**: Develop imputation strategy for late-stage time-series data
3. **Feature Engineering Priority**: Focus on early performance metrics (initial velocity, week 1 growth)
4. **Model Architecture Validation**: Strong statistical evidence supports separate Shorts/Long-form models

### ML Pipeline Implications

**Confirmed Assumptions:**
- ✅ Dual-model architecture justified by significant performance differences
- ✅ Time-series features are highly predictive (week 1 growth = 0.93 correlation)
- ✅ Early performance indicators are critical for prediction

**Feature Engineering Priorities:**
1. **Tier 1**: Like count, week 1 growth, initial velocity
2. **Tier 2**: Comment count, publication timing features
3. **Tier 3**: Engagement ratios, duration-based features

**Model Training Considerations:**
- Use separate preprocessing pipelines for Shorts vs Long-form
- Weight early performance metrics heavily in feature selection
- Consider growth pattern classification as categorical feature
- Account for missing data patterns in time-series features
