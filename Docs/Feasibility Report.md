### 1.3 The Need for the Project

The digital content creation ecosystem in Sri Lanka faces significant challenges due to the absence of localized predictive analytics tools. Content creators, digital marketers, and media companies currently rely on intuition and trial-and-error approaches rather than data-driven strategies, resulting in suboptimal content performance and reduced monetization potential.

Existing global analytics platforms such as VidIQ, TubeBuddy, and Social Blade provide historical data and general insights but fail to capture the unique characteristics of Sri Lankan audiences. These platforms lack understanding of local cultural contexts, language preferences, viewing time patterns, and regional engagement behaviors that significantly influence video performance in the Sri Lankan market.

The economic impact of this information gap is substantial. The Sri Lankan YouTube creator economy has experienced 40% year-over-year growth, with top channels generating over $2 million in annual revenue collectively. However, the lack of predictive tools means creators cannot optimize their content strategies effectively, potentially leaving significant revenue opportunities unrealized.

From a research perspective, there is a notable absence of academic studies focusing on regional social media analytics, particularly for South Asian markets. This project addresses this gap by providing both practical tools for industry use and research contributions for academic advancement.

The timing is particularly relevant as the Sri Lankan government has initiated several digital economy support programs, and there is growing recognition of the creator economy's potential contribution to national economic development. A localized analytics platform can support these initiatives by providing creators with the tools needed to compete effectively in the global digital marketplace.

### 1.4 Overview of Existing Systems and Technologies
